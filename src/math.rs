//! Spatial operations expressed in mathematical language.
//!
//! This module provides type-safe wrappers around the mathematical constructs that underpin rigid
//! body transforms (quaternions, isometries, etc.). The mathematical representation gives maximal
//! power and flexibility to construct, combine, and use these transforms, but can be hard to grok
//! for people without a mathematics-oriented background. For an interface better suited for those
//! with a background in engineering, see [`mod engineering`](crate::engineering).
//!
//! The main type provided by this module is [`RigidBodyTransform`], which describes the
//! isometry (ie, rotation and translation) between two coordinate systems (see also
//! [`CoordinateSystem`]). [`RigidBodyTransform`] implements the various mathematical operations
//! you would expect such that you can multiply them together to combine them, take one's inverse,
//! and multiply with a [`Coordinate`] or [`Vector`] to apply the isometry to transform between
//! coordinate systems.
//!
//! This module also provides the [`Rotation`] type to represents unit quaternion based transforms
//! between coordinate systems (ie, they need no translation to convert between them).
